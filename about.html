<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    As a dedicated and competent backend engineer, I bring over six years of experience in creating 
    and implementing high-performing, scalable, and secure applications. My skillset is diverse, 
    encompassing technologies such as Node.js, Golang, and C#, and I am well-versed in utilizing 
    cloud platforms like AWS. My interest extends to Blockchain technology and I enjoy creating 
    illustrations in my leisure time.
