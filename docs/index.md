A motivated and skilled backend engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing and deploying high-performance, scalable, and secure applications. Proficient in various technologies including Node.js, Golang, C# and experienced in using cloud platforms such as AWS. Besides, I am interested in Blockchain technology. During my free time, I'd like to draw some illustrations.

I am using this personal blog to share my [learnings](./web3/)  on blockchain and my [illustrations](./illustrations/) based on daily life. Follow instagram [0xdoublemoon](https://www.instagram.com/0xdoublemoon/) to see update-to-date art works.
